You will use ReactJS to build a simple web app that displays passengers and bus stops on a map.

passengers.json contains the locations of passengers. stops.json contains the locations of bus stops.

Add the following functionality to the app:
1. Display a red marker on the map at the location of each passenger. Display a blue marker on the map at the location of each bus stop.
2. Display a straight line connecting each passenger to the closest bus stop.
3. Display a popup over each bus stop on hover (when the user mouses over the stop) with the number of passengers who are closest to that stop.
